##### About the notes

- This repository contains notes taken during my graduate study.
- The notes are compiled using [Typora](https://typora.io/), and may glitch if you open them with other editors.
- When editing with `Typora`, always open `/preamble.md` first. This file contains the definitions of custom commands and symbols.

##### About the website

- The static website is generated by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
  - The markdown files are first processed by `preprocess` and then by `hugo`.
  - (For Unix users) Run `source ./watch_and_preproces.sh` to watch the files. Any edit to `/notes` will trigger `python -m preprocess`.
  - Run `hugo serve` to launch a local server.
- The theme is adapted from [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).
- TeX math expressions are rendered with `mathjax`.
